Zookeeper:
Zookeeper service in helpful, where you have mutliple nodes in the cluster

examples:
            Hadoop cluster
            Kafka messaging engine
            Storm

Purpose:

    Zookeeper helps in synchronsing information/data accross nodes in a cluster
    Zookeeper stores information in 
        Memory
        On Disk
    Znode(file): Znode stores the information which is required or needs to be shared among the mutliple nodes
    example config data:

    Zookeeper is used mainly for co-ordintation among the nodes in a cluster

Example scenario


    3 + 1 node cluster
                                        Leader          Follower Follower   
           sample request                 (node1)      (node2)    (node3)

                                Zookeeper server(znode)

Which node is processing which message ? This information is stored in Zookeeper's znode and each node will get or watch this information. Hence, same message cannot be processed more than once.

Leader selection:
If you want to select, one of the node in a clsuter as master. How would you achieve this ? This can be easily achieved using zookeeper server. 
In three node cluster Node1 is a master node, which will serve all the requests. However, this node can fail. 
Hence, when Node1 fails then immediatley in less than a second zookeeper can mark as failure and another node remianing b/w Node2 and Node3 is marked as Master.
